          We believe that creating an inclusive and supportive workplace
          environment is crucial to our way of conducting business and an
          essential part of our values system. It increases our ability to
          understand the needs of our customers and clients, and simultaneously
          creates a sense of belonging and value that enables our employees to
          perform at their best.
